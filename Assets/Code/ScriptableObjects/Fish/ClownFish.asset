  infoPlace: "Now, I understand why you\u2019d need help finding the clownfish. They\u2019re
    tiny, sneaky and pack themselves into coral like real <i>clowns</i>, heh heh.
    Just look for any reefs in the area and you\u2019re bound to find some, and I
    heard the strait running through the eastern isles has a one particularly beautiful."
  infoDetails: "As silly as they might appear, Clownfish are some of the most messed
    up fish out there, child. I\u2019d usually make a joke about them, but these
    are already a joke to nature. They are all born males, every single one, and
    yet they still birth new ones. It just weirds me out."
