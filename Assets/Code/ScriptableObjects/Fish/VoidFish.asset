  name: Void Fish
  description: A fish of legends. Few fishermen have seen it, even fewer caught one.
    They say it can unhook itself and phase through nets.
  price: 1000
  weight: 3
  infoPrice: 500
  infoPlace: "Well, child, I\u2019m afraid the Voidfish is more of a local legend
    rather than reality. I\u2019ve never seen one with my own eyes and the tales
    I\u2019ve heard, they\u2019re\u2026 well\u2026 inconsistent to say the least.
    Just don\u2019t let the search for it <i>suck</i> you in, heh."
  infoDetails: HOLY *$>%! Is that an actual Voidfish?! Like a real one?! Not a carp
    painted black? I must take it to the mainland on the nearest occasion to hand
    it over to the proper authorities to have it studied.
