  name: Gooberfish
  description: Small fish, that dwells in shallow waters. Quite nutricious, but tastes
    awful.
  price: 2
  weight: 0.5
  infoPrice: 5
  infoPlace: "Y-you haven\u2019t noticed any gooberfish??? But you were just in the
    bay! They\u2019re there, in the village bay, just turn around and look between
    the shops. Even the tutorial highlighted them for you!"
  infoDetails: "Oddly similar to sardines in many ways, just way gooier in texture.
    As such even more people as disgusted by them, even though they\u2019re an amazing
    source of nutrients. Some biologists say they\u2019re distant, shallow water,
    cousins of the Blobfish."
