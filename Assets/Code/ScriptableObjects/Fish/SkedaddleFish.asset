  infoPlace: "\u2026I thought I was the blind one here. Look under your feet, right
    now, plea\u2014 Actually, no, go look for them below the furthest south-eastern
    island!"
  infoDetails: "Scarily fast for their size, though they\u2019re far from the smartest
    or the most aware of their surroundings. This makes them possible to catch, otherwise
    I bet they\u2019d be as elusive as the legendary Voidfish. I also bet that if
    CERN ran on fish and not subatomic particles, they\u2019d use Skeddadlefish."
